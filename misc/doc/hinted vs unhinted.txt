Inter UI font files comes in two versions:

1. Without TrueType hints (the default)

2. With TrueType hints (folder with "hinted" in their name)


The TrueType hints are used by ClearType on Windows machines where ClearType
is enabled. This usually changes the appearance of the fonts and can in some
cases increase the legibility of text.

However, the hints for Inter UI are automatically generated and are not always
a good thing. Additionally, hints are little computer programs that takes up
considerable disk space, meaning that font files with hints are larger than
those without hints. This might be a consideration when using web fonts.
