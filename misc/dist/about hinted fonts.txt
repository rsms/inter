Inter font files comes in two versions: without TrueType hints
and "hinted"; with TrueType hints. This directory contains font files with
TrueType hints for use with ClearType and other compatible shapers.

Hinted fonts looks different than unhinted fonts, especially at small sizes.
Before deciding to use these hinted fonts, consider the differences in
appearance compared to the regular fonts — you may prefer unhinted fonts for
some uses.

What are hints?


The TrueType hints are used by ClearType on Windows machines where ClearType
is enabled. This usually changes the appearance of the fonts and can in some
cases increase the legibility of text.

Additionally, hints are little computer programs that takes up considerable
disk space, meaning that font files with hints are larger than those without
hints. This might be a consideration when using web fonts.

The hints for Inter are automatically generated by a program called autohint.
