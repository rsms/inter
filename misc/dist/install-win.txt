ClearType-hinted fonts

  Inter also comes with a version that has TrueType hints used by ClearType
  on Windows. This changes the appearance of the fonts when rendered on a
  system with ClearType enabled and can in some cases increase the legibility
  of text. However, the hints for Inter are automatically generated and are
  not always a good thing.

  If you do prefer to use the version with hints, use the font files in the
  folders with "hinted" in their name, like "Inter (TTF hinted)"
